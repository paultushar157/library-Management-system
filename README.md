Library management is a sub-discipline of institutional management, and issues faced in library management often overlap with those faced in managing non-profit organizations. 
A library management system (LMS) is a computerized information system that helps with the management of library resources. It's made up of interconnected subsystems that work together to efficiently manage library operations. An LMS can help reduce the time and labor involved in maintaining a library.
